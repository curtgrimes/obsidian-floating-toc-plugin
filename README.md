# floating -toc Plugin

   
Thanks to the [floating-toc](https://github.com/curtgrimes/obsidian-floating-toc-plugin) plugin for the inspiration, but since it had not been updated for a long time and was not compatible with new ob such as multi-window, I refactored the plugin and added a lot of features. Now the size of the plugin has been significantly reduced (only one thirtieth of the original), the functionality has been increased, and the performance has been improved.
